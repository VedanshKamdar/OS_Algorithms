		<h1>What is Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm</h1>
		<p>The optimal page replacement algorithm is a theoretical algorithm that selects the page for replacement that
			will not be
			used for the longest period of time in the future. This algorithm is impossible to implement in practice as
			it requires
			knowledge of future page requests, but serves as a performance benchmark for other page replacement
			algorithms.

			<br>
		</p>

		<h4>
			<li>Terms related to Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Page: a fixed size block of memory used to store data and code from a process.<br><br>
			Page fault: occurs when a program attempts to access a page that is not currently in memory. The operating
			system must then fetch the page from secondary storage (such as a hard disk) and load it into memory, which
			can be slow and impact performance. <br><br>
			Hit ratio: the percentage of page accesses that result in a page hit (i.e., the page is already in memory).
			A higher hit ratio indicates that a page replacement algorithm is performing well. <br><br>
			Page replacement is a process of moving a page from memory to disk and loading a new page into memory when
			the available memory becomes full. This technique allows the operating system to efficiently manage the
			limited physical memory available on a computer. <br><br>
		</p>

		<h4>
			<li>Disadvantages of Peterson's Solution</li>
		</h4>
		<p>The main disadvantage of optimal page replacement algorithm is that it is impossible to implement in practice
			because it requires knowledge of future page requests. As a result, it serves as a theoretical benchmark for
			other algorithms, but cannot be used as a practical solution. Additionally, the algorithm is not efficient
			for real-time systems because it requires a lot of processing power to calculate the optimal page
			replacement decision.
