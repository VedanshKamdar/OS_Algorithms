		<h1>What is Priority Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm</h1>
		<p>Priority preemptive scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm where processes with higher priority are given
			preference over processes with lower priority. The CPU can preempt a running process if a higher priority
			process becomes available, allowing for better response time and throughput for high-priority tasks. The
			algorithm assigns each process a priority value, which is typically an integer number. The processes with
			higher priority values are given CPU time first, and if a higher priority process becomes available, the
			currently running process is preempted and replaced with the higher priority process.<br>
		</p>

		<h4>
			<li>Advantages of Priority Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm</li>
		</h4>
		<p>High priority tasks are completed faster: The priority preemptive scheduling algorithm ensures that
			high-priority tasks are given preference over lower-priority tasks. This helps to complete high-priority
			tasks faster and with better response time. <br><br>

			Improved system performance: The algorithm allows for better system performance as high-priority tasks are
			given priority over low-priority tasks. This results in better resource utilization and improved overall
			system performance. <br><br>

			Flexibility in priority assignment: Priority values can be dynamically adjusted based on the needs of the
			system. This allows for greater flexibility in managing the system and responding to changing
			demands.<br><br></p>

		<h4>
			<li>Disadvantages of Priority Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm</li>
		</h4>
		<p>Low-priority tasks may suffer: If a large number of high-priority tasks are present in the system,
			low-priority tasks may suffer from starvation, resulting in increased waiting time and reduced system
			performance. <br><br>

			Risk of priority inversion: Priority inversion occurs when a low-priority task holds a resource that a
			high-priority task needs, resulting in reduced performance. The priority preemptive scheduling algorithm is
			susceptible to priority inversion, which can lead to reduced system performance. <br><br>

			Difficulty in assigning priority values: Assigning priority values to processes can be challenging,
			especially in large systems with many processes. It requires careful consideration of the importance of each
			process and the potential impact on the system if a process is given too high or too low a priority.
