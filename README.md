CPU and Disk Scheduling Algorithms
This repository contains implementations and simulations of four common scheduling algorithms: Priority Preemptive, Peterson's, First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) Disk Scheduling, and Optimal Page Replacement.

#Algorithms
##Priority Preemptive
Priority Preemptive scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm that assigns priorities to each process and allows higher-priority processes to preempt lower-priority processes.

##Peterson's
Peterson's algorithm is a synchronization technique used to prevent race conditions in critical sections of code where multiple threads or processes access shared resources.

##First-Come, First-Serve Disk Scheduling
First-Come, First-Serve Disk Scheduling is a disk scheduling algorithm that services disk requests in the order in which they arrive in the queue.

##Optimal Page Replacement
Optimal Page Replacement is a page replacement algorithm used in virtual memory systems. It replaces the page that will not be needed for the longest period of time in the future.
