    <h1>What is First-Come First-Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm</h1>
    <p>First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) is a disk scheduling algorithm in which the disk access requests are served in the
      order in which they arrive, also known as a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) method. This means that the request that is
      first in the queue will be serviced first, regardless of its location on the disk. <br><br>

      The FCFS algorithm is simple and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient scheduling algorithm
      because it does not take into account the distance between the current position of the disk arm and the location
      of the next request. This can result in longer seek times and increased disk access time.

    <h4>
      <li>Advantages of First-Come First-Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm</li>
    </h4>
    <p>Page: a fixed size block of memory used to store data and code from a process.<br><br>
      Page fault: occurs when a program attempts to access a page that is not currently in memory. The operating
      system must then fetch the page from secondary storage (such as a hard disk) and load it into memory, which
      can be slow and impact performance. <br><br>
      Hit ratio: the percentage of page accesses that result in a page hit (i.e., the page is already in memory).
      A higher hit ratio indicates that a page replacement algorithm is performing well. <br><br>
      Page replacement is a process of moving a page from memory to disk and loading a new page into memory when
      the available memory becomes full. This technique allows the operating system to efficiently manage the
      limited physical memory available on a computer. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h4>
      <li>Disadvantages of Peterson's Solution</li>
    </h4>
    <p>The main disadvantage of optimal page replacement algorithm is that it is impossible to implement in practice
      because it requires knowledge of future page requests. As a result, it serves as a theoretical benchmark for
      other algorithms, but cannot be used as a practical solution. Additionally, the algorithm is not efficient
      for real-time systems because it requires a lot of processing power to calculate the optimal page
      replacement decision.
