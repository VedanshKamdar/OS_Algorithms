    <h1>What is First-Come First-Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm</h1>
    <p>First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS) is a disk scheduling algorithm in which the disk access requests are served in the
      order in which they arrive, also known as a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) method. This means that the request that is
      first in the queue will be serviced first, regardless of its location on the disk. <br><br>

      The FCFS algorithm is simple and easy to implement, but it may not be the most efficient scheduling algorithm
      because it does not take into account the distance between the current position of the disk arm and the location
      of the next request. This can result in longer seek times and increased disk access time.

      <br>
    </p>

    <h4>
      <li>Advantages of First-Come First-Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm</li>
    </h4>
    <p>FCFS is a straightforward scheduling algorithm that does not require complex calculations or overhead. It is
      easy to implement in software and hardware. <br><br>
      FCFS is a fair scheduling algorithm because it serves the disk access requests in the order in which they
      arrive. This means that each request has an equal chance of being serviced, and no request is given preferential
      treatment. <br><br>
      FCFS guarantees that all disk access requests will eventually be serviced, even if some requests have to wait
      for a long time. This prevents any request from being starved of disk access. <br><br>
      FCFS does not reorder the disk access requests, which means that it does not interfere with the order of data
      on the disk. This can be important in certain applications where the order of data is important, such as video or
      audio playback. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h4>
      <li>Disadvantages of First-Come First-Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm</li>
    </h4>
    <p>Long waiting times: FCFS may result in some requests waiting for a long time to be serviced, especially if there
      are other requests ahead of them in the queue. This can lead to increased disk access time and lower system
      performance. <br><br>
      Inefficient use of disk: FCFS does not take into account the location of the next request on the disk, which can
      result in unnecessary disk head movement and longer seek times. This can cause decreased efficiency and slower
      overall performance of the system. <br><br>
      No priority handling: FCFS does not consider the priority of the requests, which can result in lower priority
      requests waiting for a long time to be serviced while higher priority requests are delayed. This can lead to
      inefficient use of system resources and lower system performance. <br><br>
